# PyCity Schools Analysis
This project presents current statistical information on district school test performance, specifically looking at math and reading results. The data is further broken down by school type, spending, and size.  

* When reviewing performance of the top 5 school, it is notable all are charters schools, in comparison to the 5 lowest performing schools of which are all district schools. 

* Spending per student appears to have an inverse impact on overall passing %, however this data could be skewed as the total number of students at charter schools is much lower resulting in smaller budgets and reduced per student spending. 

* Further information would be required to determine the potential impacts of other variables such as geography, socioeconomic conditions, teacher education levels, and demographics of both students and staff.
